# JavaScript Project

[Live](http://scandycuz.github.io/javascript-project/)

The goal of this game is to hit as many targets as possible with as few shots as possible. When a target is hit by a shot, that target is destroyed, and then sends out additional shots that can then hit other targets. The more target hits that are hit consecutively starting with a single shot, the more projectiles will release after each target is destroyed.

The player starts with 10 shots. If the player destroys all of the targets on a single level, they will regain the shot they used. The player also gains a shot every time points goal is met, starting at 250 points, and increasing incrementally each time. When the player runs out of shots, the game is over.
